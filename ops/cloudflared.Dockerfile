# The official image passes the high/critical scan. Pin its release tag and immutable manifest digest
# literally, so Dependabot can propose both together, and add the project's release identity and readiness
# probe. The release derives the version label and peeled upstream commit from this line; CI checks that the
# digest runs the named release. Updates are reviewed pull requests, never silently deployed.
